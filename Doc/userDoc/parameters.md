# Parameters for *OPTANO Algorithm Tuner*

*OPTANO Algorithm Tuner* (*OAT*) combines a small number of required parameters with a rich interface for configuration. This page describes all possible parameters and their default values.

When using *OAT* in a [distributed fashion](distributed.md), multiple instances can be started as workers to speed up the tuning. The possible parameters for workers can be found in a [separate section](#worker) at the end of the page. 

Note that when you execute a tuning in [several sessions](statusdump.md), most parameters are adopted from your previous session.

Finally, check the [parameter selection](parameter_selection.md) page for some general advice on how to choose some of the described parameters.

## Master

<dl>
 <dt>--help (-h)</dt>
 <dd>Prints information about usage to console.</dd>
</dl>

### <a name="required"></a>Required parameters
Most parameters in *OAT* have a default value, but you have to specify the parameters that depend on your hardware. As part of the tuning, your algorithm is run many, many times with different configurations. You need to specify how many of these runs can be conducted in parallel per node.

 <dt>--maxParallelEvaluations={NUMBER}</dt>
 <dd>The maximum number of parallel target algorithm evaluations per node.</dd>

  <dt>--maxParallelThreads={NUMBER}[maxParallelEvaluations]</dt>
 <dd>The maximum number of parallel threads per node to process parallelizable task related to the tuner algorithm. For example this parameter is used to speed up the genetic engineering. If not specified, maxParallelEvaluations is used.</dd>
</dl>

### Address
*OAT* will try to automatically detect your computing nodes' fully qualified domain names and use them for exchanging messages. If you experience connection problems on your system, you should try to set the host names explicitly.

In addition, it is possible to specify the port on which the master listens for worker connections.

<dl>
 <dt>--ownHostName={HOSTNAME}[Fully Qualified Domain Name]</dt>
 <dd>The address that the master uses for incoming messages. On some systems the FQDN cannot be resolved on the fly. In that case, please provide the FQDN or an IP address.</dd>
 <dt>--port={NUMBER} [8081]</dt>
 <dd>The port on which the master listens for worker connections. Must be identical for master and respective workers, but different for different parallel runs.</dd>
</dl>

### Target Algorithm Specific Parameters
In addition to the required parameters, you will often want to change parameters that are closely connected to the algorithm you are tuning the parameters for.

In each iteration, configurations are evaluated using a random subset of the provided training instances. The size of these subsets increases throughout the run such that the best configurations which we still evaluate in later iterations have been evaluated on the largest number of instances. The exact number of instances to use can be specified via parameters.

<dl>
 <dt>--trainingInstanceFolder={PATH}</dt>
 <dd>The complete path to the folder containing instances. Handled differently by each application.<br>
Note: For most applications, if you execute <i>OAT</i> in a distributed fashion, you will have to make sure that all computing nodes either can access the same instance folder or have identical instance folders stored at identical paths.</dd>

 <dt>--testInstanceFolder={PATH}</dt>
 <dd>Similar to <code>--trainingInstanceFolder</code>, but only used for <a href="../developerDoc/logging.md">additional information on incumbent quality</a> in case <code>--scoreGenerationHistory</code> is provided.</dd>

 <dt>--instanceNumbers={NUMBER:NUMBER} (-i) [5:100]</dt>
 <dd>The number of instances to use at the first generation and the number of instances to use at the end. Instance numbers increase linearly from the start until <i>goalGen</i> and then stay at maximum size until the end of the tuning.</dd>

 <dt>--addDefaultGenome={BOOLEAN} [true]</dt>
 <dd>Value indicating whether to include a genome that uses the target algorithm's default parameter values, if they are specified. If a parameter does not have a specified default value, a randomized value from its domain is used instead.</dd>
</dl>

#### <a name="racing"></a>Speedups in Tuning
**Racing**: Loosely speaking, racing means to skip evaluating a configuration further once it becomes clear that it can not beat the current numberOfTournamentWinner-best configuration and therefore won't get to be a mini tournament winner. Of course, this ordering strongly depends on your overall tuning metric. For example, in runtime tuning with one mini tournament winner racing can skip evaluations once a configuration's total runtime exceeds the total runtime, needed by the best configuration to solve all instances. Thereby this strategy has the potential to greatly reduce the tuner's run time because the worst configurations are evaluated less often. Moreover this might lead you to introduce an evaluation priority of a configuration, based on its ability to be a racing threshold candidate. The [basic version of OAT](basic_usage.md) comes with two basic tuning metrices: (penalized) runtime tuning and pure value tuning. While you cannot use racing in pure value tuning, (penalized) runtime tuning comes with a full featured implementation of this strategy. When [tuning for custom optimization functions](../developerDoc/advanced.md) you can provide your own tuning metric, racing strategy and evaluation priority score by implementing the `IRunEvaluator` interface. The [Gurobi example](../developerDoc/gurobi.md) provides an exemplary implementation on how to customize your strategy.

**CPU Timeout**: Racing is useful, but only checks the run times between finished algorithm runs. That means that a really long run will never be cancelled, and the bad configuration will only be ignored afterwards. To avoid this problem, a CPU timeout can be set per run. Runs will be cancelled after this time and the run time will be counted as the run time until cancellation.

 <dd>Value indicating whether racing should be enabled.</dd>

 <dt>--cpuTimeout={SECONDS} (-t) [int.MaxValue]</dt>

#### <a id="model-based-parameters" name="model-based-parameters"></a>[Model-Based Crossover](../developerDoc/model_based_crossover.md) Parameters
*OAT* also implements [GGA++](algorithms.md#gga-1) by providing a model-based crossover operator that can be used for creating new offspring. Note that some of the parameters can have a significant impact on the time consumed for the population update. The application of this operator is also referred to as _Genetic Engineering_.

  The <i>"#features"</i> refers to the length of your parameter tree's double[]-representation. Setting <i>"forestFeaturesPerSplitRatio"</i> to <i>1/sqrt(#features)</i> means that the trees will be trained with <i>#features * 1/sqrt(#features) = sqrt(#features)</i>, which is a commonly used value according to the literature.</dd>

### CMA-ES Parameters
As detailed on the [page about tuning algorithms](algorithms.md), it is possible to employ the CMA-ES parameter tuner instead of the default GGA(++) one.

</dl>

## Worker
As *OAT* instances that are started as workers connect with a master and get most information from there, they need almost no parameters. Essentially, all they need to know is how to connect to the master. You may additionally change how much information they print to console.

 <dd>The port on which the master listens for worker connections. Must be identical for master and respective workers, but different for different parallel runs.</dd>
</dl>

### Own Address
*OAT* will try to automatically detect your computing nodes' fully qualified domain names and use them for exchanging messages. If you experience connection problems on your system, you should try to set the host names explicitly.
<dl>
 <dt>--ownHostName={HOSTNAME}[Fully Qualified Domain Name]</dt>
 <dd>The address that the worker uses for incoming messages. On some systems the FQDN cannot be resolved on the fly. In that case, please provide the FQDN or an IP address.</dd>
