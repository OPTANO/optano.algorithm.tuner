# OPTANO Algorithm Tuner

OPTANO Algorithm Tuner (OAT) is a .Net-API that helps tuning (finding near-optimal parameter) for any given target algorithm. It is easy to use and full featured. For detailed information, please see [What is OAT?](https://docs.optano.com/algorithm.tuner/current/userDoc/whatisalgorithmtuner.html)

# Easy Start

Download the [Generic OPTANO Algorithm Tuner Application](https://docs.optano.com/algorithm.tuner/current/download.html) and follow [these instructions](https://docs.optano.com/algorithm.tuner/current/userDoc/basic_usage.html).
